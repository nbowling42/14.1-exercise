**Part 1**
- HTTP is the protocol used to send/receive information between the client and a server.

- A url is the specific address of a webpage including the protocol (ftp, http, etc.), the hostname, and any resource/query strings.

- A DNS or domain name system, is a server which takes a hostname such as google.com and returns the specific ip address associated with that hostname.

- A query string is optional information passed into a url usually after submitting forms using GET.

- GET and POST:
	* GET - Used to retrieve information from a server with no side effects, usually data is passed in as query strings.
	* POST - Used to access a server with side effects (creating new password, etc.), data is usually passed in the request body.

- An http request is a request passed to a server from a client using the http protocol.

- An http response is a respones passed to a client from a server using the http protocol.

- An http header is additional information passed into the request or the response:
	* Accept: text/html	- request header
	* Accept-Language: en-us	- request header
	* Last-Modified		- response header
	* Content-Type		- response header

- First your browser will turn the hostname into a proper ip address using the domain name system, then it will make a request to that server and hopefully get a response back with a status code of 200, then your client-side machine will build the DOM and make any additional http request it needs (images, link tags, etc.).
